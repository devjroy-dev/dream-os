# TDW_04_AUDIT_FINDINGS — the §3.5 audit sitting (sitting one), 2026-07-15

**Executor:** TDW_04 session (fresh, inheriting the interrupted sitting's banked rulings)
**Evidence header:** dream-os HEAD `e82b6e2` ("TDW_03 CLOSED at P2…") · dreamos-pwa HEAD `f9872e0` ("TDW_03 R1(b)…") · read-only static audit against fresh clones; no code changed, no DB queried (row-level checks delivered as founder-run SQL, this packet's companion).
**Standard applied:** every ST file:line claim from `docs/SURFACE_TRUTH_AUDIT.md` verified against HEAD; classification per the banked taxonomy — **moved-line** (±few lines / path imprecision, claim substantively true) · **superseded** (code lawfully moved past the claim) · **real-drift** (claim materially wrong → CE). F16 reconciled at the two-independent-readings bar, not re-derived.

## 1. HEAD + ladder truths

| # | Finding | Class |
|---|---|---|
| A-1 | dream-os HEAD is **exactly** `e82b6e2` — the pre-classified "expected docs-only delta" past it never materialized (the hotfix-close docs commit `eebb4bf` *predates* `e82b6e2`). Zero delta. Ratified by founder 2026-07-15 as finding, not drift. | finding |
| A-2 | dreamos-pwa HEAD exactly `f9872e0` — as expected. | finding |
| A-3 | Ladder tail `0074_drop_scope_org_id.sql` applied → **0075/0076 free** per L-7; **0077 ruled to this block 2026-07-15** (convergence data migration — v1's third reservation that slipped the consolidation note); 0095 stands reserved (Addendum B). Holes 0068/0073 harmless per LD-8. | verified |
| A-4 | F12 DDL (engine.usage `cache_read_tokens`/`cache_write_tokens`): **APPLIED 2026-07-15, founder-run, verification on record with the CE** (both columns present, integer, nullable). BASELINE rider delivered in this ZIP per founder mandate. Engine-lane sitting reads the columns as live. | verified |

Binder/lead doors confirmed **never** log → ST-3d gap real | moved-line |

## 4. ST verification — dreamos-pwa

## 5. Part B ground truth (v1 READ-FIRST verification)

| # | Finding | Class / action |
|---|---|---|
| B-1 | **THE P1 QUESTION: separate table CONFIRMED.** `availability.js` + `lib/vendor/availability.js` read/write `public.vendor_availability` (insert/delete/list; unique vendor_id+blocked_date, 23505→ALREADY_BLOCKED). P1 does NOT collapse → 0077 is real. **Wire truth for the shape-preserving view:** GET returns `{ok, blocks:[{id, blocked_date, reason, created_at}], total}` — field is `blocked_date`, not v1's illustrative `date`; `total` also rides. PWA `fetchAvailability` keys on `blocked_date` (calendar page :96). | verified — P1 proceeds full |
| B-2 | **Discover/couple availability readers: NONE.** Exhaustive grep (vendor_availability / listBlocks / blocked_date) across src/: only the vendor pair. v1 P1.4's derivation task resolves to a recorded nothing. | superseded (task dissolves) |
| B-3 | **Lockstep already exists both directions at HEAD** — v1 P2's lockstep sub-task is *relocation, not greenfield*: (a) event→binder via `executeAndPatch(donna_date)` inside chat.js mutateEvents :292–297 (witnessed, trail written); (b) binder→event via `lockstepBinderToEvent` :329–350 — but this direction writes `public.events` **raw** (`.update()` direct) with a loop-guard-by-architecture comment. After P2 the raw write must route through eventWrite (guardrail law). (c) **CRUD-side lockstep is genuinely absent** — `events.js` PATCH carries none; v1 P2(b) builds it. Also present and unnamed by the spec: `retroLinkOnFile` (chat.js :220+ — links unlinked events when a client binder files) — must survive relocation. | superseded-in-part; P2 scope sharpened |
| B-4 | Dedupe + backlink sources for eventWrite's verbatim move: `findExistingEvent` :203–219 (same-date + title-hint ilike, single confident match) and `resolveBinderForBooking` :134–149 (explicit binder_id or confident single name-match). | verified |
| B-5 | **Category taxonomy drift (→ CE, question Q-2 below):** `categoryProfiles.js` PROFILES keys are `makeup, photography, designer, jewellery, decor, venue` (+ alias videography→photography; generic 'other' fallback), `timelineType: event|delivery`. C4's default table names photographer/**mua**/decorator/**florist** — key-name mismatches are cosmetic (map keys to code truth), but **florist has no profile** (falls to 'other' → occupancy off + `occupancy_unmapped`, contradicting C4's florist:2 default) and **venue exists with no C4 ruling** (event-type; capacity semantics unruled). planner: no key → 'other' → occupancy off — consistent with C4 by fallback. | **real-drift → CE** |
| B-6 | 0069: `blocked` kind live in the events CHECK (13 values). 0070: `linked_binder_id` + partial index live. `hot_dates` per SCHEMA (shared, read-only). | verified |
| B-7 | `me.js` PATCH ALLOWED_FIELDS (:70) lacks `slot_capacity` — B3's "add to allowlist, smallest change" path confirmed viable. `settings/page.tsx` has no capacity row (expected pre-B3). | verified |
| B-8 | Calendar sight already flows: `fetchCalendarSnapshot` → runTurn's `calendarSnapshot` (chat.js :350,:543,:601; loop.ts :208). P4 verifies against post-engine-lane snapshot shape as amended. | verified |
| B-9 | `schedules.js` milestone shapes present (create/PATCH/`:milestoneId/paid`; PATCH allowlist `milestone_label,due_date,pct`) — B5's source confirmed. | verified |

## 6. Out-of-scope findings (appended to FINDINGS_LOG under this sitting; owners named)

| # | Finding | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| O-1 | **SCHEMA.md doc-lag ×3** (schema never moved; docs lag prod): (a) `invoices.binder_id` exists in prod (used by generateInvoiceForBinder `.eq('binder_id',…)`; BASELINE's 21-column count only reconciles with it) but SCHEMA's invoices table omits it — no live-ladder migration adds it; (b) `events.deleted_at` exists (events.js GET filters on it in prod) — SCHEMA's events table omits it (BASELINE's 14 columns reconcile with it); (c) SCHEMA's events `kind` row says "12 values" and omits `blocked` — 0069 (applied, in the ladder) makes it 13. Proposed one-line riders drafted; CE ratifies, next delivery carries them. | CE ruling → next 04 delivery |
| O-2 | `context.js` typed reads carry **no `deleted_at` filters** (leads-new count, invoices list) — soft-deleted rows can inflate the chat masthead. Dies naturally at A3's repoint (L-4); logged so the repoint's acceptance covers it explicitly. | 04 A3 |
| O-3 | ST's activity-writer census minutely incomplete: `harvest_cross_scope` (harvest.js) and the WA engine (`engine.js:268`) also log. Doesn't alter ST-3d (doors still never log). | record only |
| O-4 | glance path in ST is `lib/vendor/glance.ts`; truth is `src/engine/src/core/glance.ts`. | record only |

## 7. Questions for the Chief Engineer

- **Q-1 (ratify):** the L-9 absorption text and 0077 extension written into the spec (both founder/CE-ruled, dated) — confirm the wording as recorded.
- **Q-2 (B-5, blocks B3):** the category map — rule florist (add a profile key / accept unknown→off until one exists?) and venue (occupancy mode + capacity default, or explicitly OFF pending a ruling?). Key names in B3's map will follow code truth (`photography/makeup/decor/jewellery/designer/venue`).
- **Q-3 (ratify):** O-1's three SCHEMA one-liners — say the word and they ride the next delivery.
- **Q-4 (record):** B-3's sharpened P2 scope (relocate two live lockstep legs + build the missing CRUD leg + preserve retroLinkOnFile) — confirm this reading of "moved, not rewritten" extends to the raw b→e write being re-routed through eventWrite.

## 8. Verification state

Docs-only delivery: no `.js`/`.tsx` touched → node --check / tsc gates N/A this sitting (they gate every code delivery from the engine-lane sitting onward). Companion founder-run SQL (F14 export-then-soft-delete; Ritika & Arjun signature check; vendor_availability row counts) delivered in-chat per the §7 SQL exception.

## 9. ADDENDUM — rulings returned (founder/CE, 2026-07-15, before the engine-lane sitting)

- **Q-1 RATIFIED** — L-9/L-10/0077 spec wording stands as recorded.
- **Q-2 RULED** — code taxonomy is truth; B3's capacity map rides the code keys, never the spec's stale names. Ruled profiles + defaults (each vendor-editable in the B3 settings row): `photography` 1/day, `makeup` 1/day, `decor` 1/day (person-bound) · `venue` 1/day (space-bound) · **`florist` ADDED, 3/day (production-bound)** · `other` 1/day as the floor. B3 implements exactly this.
- **Q-3 RATIFIED** — SCHEMA riders ride the next docs commit. **O-1(a) RETRACTED at that commit** (invoices.binder_id was already documented — executor mis-read, self-logged in FINDINGS_LOG); O-1(b) events.deleted_at + O-1(c) blocked-kind/0069-index applied.
- **Q-4 CONFIRMED** — the sharpened P2 lockstep reading stands: two legs live and relocate verbatim, the CRUD leg is built new, the raw binder→event write re-routes through eventWrite, retroLinkOnFile preserved verbatim.
- **F14 CLOSED at every layer** — export archived, soft-delete verified, snapshot pre-read empty (no line existed to die).
- **Ritika & Arjun ×2 CLOSED** — CE-19-class name-drift predating its own fix, founder-cleaned; recorded in TDW_03_CROSSPLANE_CENSUS.md; no distinct-mechanism claim survives.
- **0077 COLLAPSES to guarded structural convergence** — `vendor_availability` holds zero rows; no data preservation leg. Executor's documented choice, made here: **0077 ships standalone** (`0077_availability_convergence.sql`, structural-only, guarded) rather than folding into 0075 — the ladder stays one-concern-per-file and the ruling's dated header stays legible on its own migration. Lands with B1.
